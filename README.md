# ptag
ptag is a high speed image viewer, with the ability to adjust EXIF ratings and captions.
No direct image manipulation is done - only EXIF data is modifed.

ptag will preload images ready for viewing so that image display is fast.

The [fyne](https://fyne.io/) toolkit is used for window management and display,
and the [vips](https://github.com/davidbyttow/govips) library for image handling.

Run ```ptag --help``` to get the usage and keyboard shortcuts supported.
