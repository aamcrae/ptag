# ptag
ptag is a high speed image viewer, with the ability to adjust EXIF ratings and captions

ptag will preload images reading for viewing, so that image display is fast.

The [fyne](https://fyne.io/) toolkit is used for window management and display,
and the [vips](https://github.com/davidbyttow/govips) library for image handling.
